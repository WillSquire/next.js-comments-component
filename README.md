# Example comments component

A basic and minimalistic example of a recursive comment component (no styling) as a quick test.
This wouldn't be used in a real application as it's mainly client side and it's not production-grade.
Bootstrapped with a few comments to start it off using SSR (no need for an API call).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm`, etc.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
